# Intro

In this section we derive a general set of differential equations that describe the time evolution of mechanical systems subjected to holonomic constraints, when the constraint forces satisfy the principle of virtual work. 

These are called the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion. 

Note that there are at least two distinct ways of deriving these equations:
- The method presented here is based on the method of virtual displacements
- but it is also possible to derive the same equations based on Hamiltonâ€™s principle of least action
