# Robotics

Robotics is a relatively young field of modern technology that crosses traditional engineering boundaries. 

Understanding the complexity of robots and their applications requires knowledge of:
- electrical engineering
- mechanical engineering
- systems
- industrial engineering
- computer science
- economics
- mathematics

New disciplines of engineering, such as:
- manufacturing engineering
- applications engineering
- knowledge engineering 

have emerged to deal with the complexity of the field of robotics and factory automation.

>Book Content
- This book is concerned with fundamentals of robotics, including:
    - kinematics
    - dynamics
    - motion planning
    - computer vision
    - control

>Goal
- Our goal is to provide a complete introduction to the most important concepts in these subjects as applied to industrial robot manipulators.

The science of robotics has grown tremendously over the past twenty years, fueled by rapid advances in computer and sensor technology as well as theoretical advances in control and computer vision. 

In addition to the topics listed above, robotics encompasses several areas not covered in this text such as:
- locomotion, including wheeled and legged robots, flying
and swimming robots, grasping, artificial intelligence, computer architectures, programming languages, and computer-aided design. 

A complete treatment of the discipline of robotics would require several volumes. 

Nevertheless, at the present time, the vast majority of robot applications deal with industrial robot arms operating in structured factory environments so that a first introduction to the subject of robotics must include a rigorous treatment of the topics in this text.
