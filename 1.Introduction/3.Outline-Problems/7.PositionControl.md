# Position Control

Control theory is used in Chapters 10 and 11 to design control algorithms for the execution of programmed tasks. The motion control problem consists of the Tracking and Disturbance Rejection Problem, which is the problem of determining the control inputs necessary to follow, or track, a desired trajectory that has been planned for the manipulator, while simultaneously rejecting disturbances due to unmodelled dynamic effects such as friction and noise. 

We detail the standard approaches to robot control based on frequency domain techniques. We also introduce the notion of feedforward control and the techniques of computed torque and inverse dynamics as a means for compensating the complex nonlinear interaction forces among the links of the manipulator. 

Robust control is introduced in Chapter 11 using the Second Method of Lyapunov. Chapter ?? provides some additional advanced techniques from nonlinear control theory that are useful for controlling high performance robots.
