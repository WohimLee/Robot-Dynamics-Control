# Force Control

Once the manipulator has reached location A. it must follow the contour S maintaining a constant force normal to the surface. Conceivably, knowing the location of the object and the shape of the contour, we could carry out this task using position control alone. This would be quite difficult to accomplish in practice, however. Since the manipulator itself possesses high rigidity, any errors in position due to uncertainty in the exact location of the surface or tool would give rise to extremely large forces at the end-effector that could damage the tool, the surface, or the robot. A better approach is to measure the forces of interaction directly and use a force control scheme to accomplish the task. 


In Chapter 12 we discuss force control and compliance and discuss the two most common approaches to force control, hybrid control and impedance control.
