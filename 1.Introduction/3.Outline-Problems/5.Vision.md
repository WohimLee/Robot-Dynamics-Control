Cameras have become reliable and relatively inexpensive sensors in many robotic applications. Unlike joint sensors, which give information about the internal configuration of the robot, cameras can be used not only to measure the position of the robot but also to locate objects external to the robot in its workspace. 

In Chapter 6 we discuss the use of cameras to obtain position and orientation of objects.
