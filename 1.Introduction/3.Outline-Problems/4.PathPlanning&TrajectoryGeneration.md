# Path Planning and Trajectory Generation

The robot control problem is typically decomposed heirarchically into three tasks: 
- path planning
- trajectory generation
- trajectory tracking

The path planning problem, considered in Chapter 7, is to determine a path in task space (or configuration space) to move the robot to a goal position while avoiding collisions with objects in its workspace. These paths are encode position information without timing considerations, i.e. without considering velocities and accelerations along the planned paths. The tractory generation problem, considered in Chapter 8 is to generate reference trajectories that determine the time history of the manipulator along a given path or between initial and final configurations.
