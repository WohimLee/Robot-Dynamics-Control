# Dynamics
A robot manipulator is basically a positioning device. To control the position we must know the dynamic properties of the manipulator in order to know how much force to exert on it
to cause it to move: too little force and the manipulator is slow to react; too much force and the arm may crash into objects or oscillate about its desired position.
Deriving the dynamic equations of motion for robots is not a simple task due to the large number of degrees of freedom and nonlinearities present in the system. 

In Chapter 9 we develop techniques based on Lagrangian dynamics for systematically deriving the equations of motion of such a system. In addition to the rigid links, the complete description of robot dynamics includes the dynamics of the actuators that produce the forces and torques to drive the robot, and the dynamics of the drive trains that transmit the power from
the actuators to the links. Thus, in Chapter 10 we also discuss actuator and drive train dynamics and their effects on the control problem.
