# Inverse Kinematics

Now, given the joint angles $θ_1$, $θ_2$ we can determine the end-effector coordinates x and y.

In order to command the robot to move to location B we need the inverse; that is, we need the joint variables θ1, θ2 in terms of the x and y coordinates of B. This is the problem of `Inverse Kinematics`. In other words, given x and y in the forward kinematic equations $(1.1-1.2)$, we wish to solve for the joint angles. Since the forward kinematic equations are nonlinear, a solution may not be easy to find nor is there a unique solution in general. 

We can see, for example, in the case of a two-link planar mechanism that there may be no solution, if the given $(x, y)$ coordinates are out of reach of the manipulator. If the given $(x, y)$ coordinates are within the manipulator’s reach there may be two solutions as shown in Figure 1.26, the so-called elbow up and elbow down configurations, or there may be exactly one solution if the manipulator must be fully extended to reach the point.

There may even be an infinite number of solutions in some cases (Problem 1.25).

Consider the diagram of Figure 1.27. Using the Law of Cosines we see that the angle $θ_2$ is given by

$$cosθ_2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2-α_1^2 - α_2^2}{2α_1α_2} = D \tag{1.5}$$

We could now determine $θ_2$ as

$$θ_2 = cos^{-1}(D) \tag{1.6}$$

However, a better way to find $θ_2$ is to notice that if $cos(θ_2)$ is given by $(1.5)$ then $sin(θ_2)$ is given as

$$sin(θ_2) = \pm\sqrt{1-D^2} \tag{1.7}$$

and, hence, $θ_2$ can be found by

$$θ_2 = tan^{-1} \frac{\pm\sqrt{1-D^2}}{D}$$

The advantage of this latter approach is that both the elbow-up and elbow-down solutions are recovered by choosing the positive and negative signs in $(1.8)$, respectively.

It is left as an exercise (Problem $1.19$) to show that $θ_1$ is now given as

$$θ_1 = tan^{-1}(y/x) - tan^{-1}\Big(\frac{α_2 sinθ_2}{α_1 + α_2 cosθ_2}\Big)$$

Notice that the angle $θ_1$, depends on $θ_2$. This makes sense physically since we would expect to require a different value for $θ_1$, depending on which solution is chosen for $θ_2$.
