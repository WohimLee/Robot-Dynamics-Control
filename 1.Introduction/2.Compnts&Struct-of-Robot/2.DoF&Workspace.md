# Degree of Freedom and Workspace
## 1 DoF
The number of joints determines the degrees-of-freedom (DOF) of the manipulator. Typically, a manipulator should possess at least six independent DOF: 
- three for positioning
- three for orientation. 

With fewer than six DOF the arm cannot reach every point in its work environment with arbitrary orientation. Certain applications such as reaching around or behind obstacles require more than six DOF. 

The difficulty of controlling a manipulator increases rapidly with the number of links. A manipulator having more than six links is referred to as a kinematically redundant manipulator.

## 2 Workspace

>Definition
- The workspace of a manipulator is the total volume swept out by the end-effector as the manipulator executes all possible motions. 

The workspace is constrained by the geometry of the manipulator as well as mechanical constraints on the joints. For example, a revolute joint may be limited to less than a full 360 degree of motion. 

The workspace is often broken down into:
- a reachable workspace: The reachable workspace is the entire set of points reachable by the manipulator
- a dextrous workspace: The dextrous workspace consists of those points that the manipulator can reach with an arbitrary orientation of the end effector


Obviously the dextrous workspace is a subset of the reachable workspace. The workspaces of several robots are shown later in this chapter.
