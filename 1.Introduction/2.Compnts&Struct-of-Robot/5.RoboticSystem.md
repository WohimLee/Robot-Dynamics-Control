# Robotic Systems

A robot manipulator should be viewed as more than just a series of mechanical linkages. The mechanical arm is just one component to an overall Robotic System, shown in Figure 1.20, which consists of the arm, external power source, end-of-arm tooling, external and internal sensors, computer interface, and control computer.

Even the programmed software should be considered as an integral part of the overall system, since the manner in which the robot is programmed and controlled can have a major impact on its performance and subsequent range of applications.
