# Spherical Configuration (RRP)
By replacing the third or elbow joint in the revolute configuration by a prismatic joint one obtains the spherical configuration shown in Figure 1.7.

The term spherical configuration derives from the fact that the spherical coordinates defining the position of the end-effector with respect to a frame whose origin lies at the intersection of the axes $z_1$ and $z_2$ are the same as the first three joint variables.

Figure 1.8 shows the Stanford Arm, one of the most well-known spherical robots. The workspace of a spherical manipulator is shown in Figure 1.9
