# Common Kinematic Arrangements

## 1 Articulated Configuration (RRR)
The articulated manipulator is also called a revolute, or anthropomorphic manipulator.

The ABB IRB1400 articulated arm is shown in Figure 1.3.

A common revolute joint design is the parallelogram linkage such as the Motoman SK16, shown in Figure 1.4.

In both of these arrangements joint axis $z_2$ is parallel to $z_1$ and both $z_1$ and $z_2$ are perpendicular to $z_0$. The structure and terminology associated with the elbow manipulator are shown in Figure 1.5.

Its workspace is shown in Figure 1.6.

The `revolute configuration` provides for relatively large freedom of movement in a compact space. The parallelogram linkage, although less dextrous typically than the `elbow manipulator configuration`, nevertheless has several advantages that make it an attractive and popular design. 

The most notable feature of the parallelogram linkage configuration is that the actuator for joint 3 is located on link 1. Since the weight of the motor is born by link 1, links 2 and 3 can be made more lightweight and the motors themselves can be less powerful. Also the dynamics of the parallelogram manipulator are simpler than those of the elbow manipulator, thus making it easier to control.


&emsp;
## 2 Spherical Configuration (RRP)
By replacing the third or elbow joint in the revolute configuration by a prismatic joint one obtains the spherical configuration shown in Figure 1.7.

The term spherical configuration derives from the fact that the spherical coordinates defining the position of the end-effector with respect to a frame whose origin lies at the intersection of the axes $z_1$ and $z_2$ are the same as the first three joint variables. 

Figure 1.8 shows the Stanford Arm, one of the most well-known spherical robots. The workspace of a spherical manipulator is shown in
