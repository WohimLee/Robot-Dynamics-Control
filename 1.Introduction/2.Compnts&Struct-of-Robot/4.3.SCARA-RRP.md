# SCARA Configuration (RRP)
The so-called SCARA (for Selective Compliant Articulated Robot for Assembly) shown in Figure 1.10 is a popular configuration, which, as its name suggests, is tailored for assembly operations.

Although the SCARA has an RRP structure, it is quite different from the spherical configuration in both appearance and in its range of applications. Unlike the spherical design, which has $z_0$, $z_1$, $z_2$ mutually perpendicular, the SCARA has $z_0$, $z_1$, $z_2$ parallel.

Figure 1.11 shows the Epson E2L653S, a manipulator of this type. The SCARA manipulator workspace is shown in Figure 1.12.
