# SCARA Configuration (RRP)
The so-called SCARA (for Selective Compliant Articulated Robot for Assembly) shown in
Figure 1.10 is a popular configuration, which, as its name suggests, is tailored for assembly
operations. Although the SCARA has an RRP structure, it is quite different from the
spherical configuration in both appearance and in its range of applications. Unlike the
spherical design, which has z0, z1, z2 mutually perpendicular, the SCARA has z0, z1, z2
parallel. Figure 1.11 shows the Epson E2L653S, a manipulator of this type. The SCARA
manipulator workspace is shown in Figure 1.12.
