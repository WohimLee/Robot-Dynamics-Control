# Representing Positions

Before developing representation schemes for points and vectors, it is instructive to distinguish between the two fundamental approaches to geometric reasoning: 
- the synthetic approach
- the analytic approach

In the former, one reasons directly about geometric entities (e.g., points or lines), while in the latter, one represents these entities using coordinates or equations, and reasoning is performed via algebraic manipulations.

Consider Figure 2.1. Using the synthetic approach, without ever assigning coordinates to points or vectors, one can say that $x_0$ is perpendicular to $y_0$, or that $\vec{v}_1 × \vec{v}_2$ defines a vector that is perpendicular to the plane containing $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$, in this case pointing out of the page.

In robotics, one typically uses analytic reasoning, since robot tasks are often defined in a Cartesian workspace, using Cartesian coordinates. Of course, in order to assign coordinates it is necessary to specify a coordinate frame. Consider again Figure 2.1. We could specify the coordinates of the point p with respect to either frame $o_0x_0y_0$ or frame $o_1x_1y_1$. In the former case, we might assign to p the coordinate vector $(5, 6)^T$, and in the latter case $(−3, 4)^T$. So that the reference frame will always be clear, we will adopt a notation in which a superscript is used to denote the reference frame. Thus, we would write
