# Intro

In order to represent the relative position and orientation of one rigid body with respect to another, we will rigidly attach coordinate frames to each body, and then specify the geometric relationships between these coordinate frames. 

In Section 2.1 we have already seen how one can represent the position of the origin of one frame with respect to another frame. 

In this section, we address the problem of describing the orientation of one coordinate frame relative to another frame. We begin with the case of rotations in the plane, and then generalize our results to the case of orientations in a three dimensional space.
